# Marauder

Marauder is a security research tool designed to help analyze and extract threat intelligence from the dark web. It's currently in beta, and under active development.

The project is being shared in its current form to gather feedback and encourage community involvement. Expect frequent changes, and note that features may be incomplete or unstable.

🛠️ This README is a work in progress — more detailed documentation and usage examples will be added soon.

Stay tuned for updates, and thanks for checking out the project!
